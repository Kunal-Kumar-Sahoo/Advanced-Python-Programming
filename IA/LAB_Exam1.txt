Task1: students_scores_test.csv

File Operations:

Read the dataset (students_scores_test.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame. Use 'subprocess' to check if the "students_scores_test" file exists in the current directory. If it doesn't exist, log an error message and terminate the task.
Display rows 3 to 7 of the dataset.
Save the updated dataset back to a new CSV file (updated_data.csv).

Logging:
Create a log file to record important events and messages throughout the task.
Log messages for the following:
"Checking if 'students_scores_test.csv' file exists..."
"Dataset read successfully."
"Saving the updated dataset to 'updated_data.csv'."
"CSV file is not found."


NumPy Basics:
Use NumPy to find the hightest and lowest scores from the dataset.
Log the results of these calculations.

Pandas Basics:
Filter the dataset to display only the rows where scores are greater than 70 with group 'A'.

Scheduling:
Schedule the entire task to run automatically on 1st date of every month at 00:00 AM.
Ensure that the logs are appended for each run.

Submit the following:
Python script (main.py) containing the code for the lab task.
The dataset file (students_scores_test.csv) with the appended row and the updated file (updated_data.csv).
Log file (log.txt) containing all the logged messages from your script.
